      How to kick the extension in: Step 1. Send all your hard-earned cash to
      me. Step 2. Disregard Step 1, but in case you liked this extension and
      feel like you can afford a coffee to support me, click here: link Real
      step 1. Go to the page you want to i-control. Step 2. Click on the
      extension's icon. Click enable or always enable on this page button. After
      clicking once on the page, the algorithm will start to run, based on the
      configuration on the popup. Step 3. Configure the popup, then, if it's the
      first time you eye-control this page, click on the tutorial button, and go
      thrugh it. Step 4. Start reading on the page. Make sure you gaze on the
      specific side you want to scroll towards. After looking at a side for long
      enough - given the algorithm didn't hit its head - you should start to see
      an arrow rising and a circul forming around it. When the arrow fully
      loads, it will do a cute animation, then go down, and a scroll will
      happen. If you want to cancel a scrolling, just look at the opposing side
      for a bit. Step 5. Meddle with the options page, and make the algo better,
      then send it to us :D Thank you for giving it a go, I hope it will be of
      some use for you. If you have some hardships, like disabilities, then
      maybe you will use it to read long documents without needed interactions.
      If you are lazy to click, then... Start programming, lazy people make the
      best life-improving tools. Also, then you can use this tool to read stuff,
      like books, manga or comics while eating popcorn with two hands (img about
      it?) And finally, if you just tried it out because it seemed fun: I hope
      your curiosity got fulfilled! I'm looking forward to hear from you
      proposing to improve this extension, reporting bugs, or just saying hi.
      You can do any of these here: address
